In more detail, this quote emphasizes that striving to write highly optimized code from the outset can often lead to complex, hard-to-understand solutions, which in turn may introduce bugs or hinder future development. It's wiser to ensure your code works correctly and is easy to understand, then optimize specific parts once you have concrete evidence (through profiling) that those parts are performance bottlenecks. This principle aligns with the modern software development practices that prioritize readability, modularity, and testability over speculative optimizations.

Second, use time management techniques to plan out your day or week. Block out time for specific tasks so that when you sit down to code, you know what you need to accomplish. Using a scheduling tool like Todoist or Trello can help keep you organized and on track.

 Additionally, always keep your code organized, documented, version controlled, etc. These practices will save you time and headaches down the road. Make sure you understand the code you're working on and if you don't, take the time to learn it. If you find yourself constantly struggling with a concept, consider reaching out to a colleague or taking a course to improve your understanding.

- "Today's programming wisdom: 'Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.' — Leonardo da Vinci. In software development, this translates to striving for clear, concise code that's easy to understand and maintain. It's not just about writing fewer lines but also about designing elegant solutions that can withstand the test of time. Always remember, you're not just coding for the machine, but also for fellow human beings who will read, debug, and build upon your work." 

"In addition, 'Premature optimization is the root of all evil' as Donald Knuth wisely said. This highlights the importance of focusing on correctness and clarity first, before optimizing performance. Refactor and optimize only when it's necessary, based on real-world usage data and performance metrics."

- Today's programming wisdom is to prioritize tasks, plan ahead, and stay organized. This will help you to be more efficient and productive in your work. By using task management tools, such as Trello or Asana, you can keep track of your progress and make sure you don't get sidetracked.

Remember to take breaks throughout the day to avoid burnout and maintain focus. Additionally, always keep learning and updating your skills. The technology industry is constantly evolving, so it' s essential to stay current on new trends and technologies. You can do this by reading blogs, attending conferences, or joining online communities.

- Today's programming wisdom: "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. In software engineering, strive to write clear, concise code that can be easily understood and maintained by others. Remember that code is read far more often than it's written, so prioritize readability and modularity over premature optimization. Always keep in mind the SOLID principles, DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, and KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle. Continuously refactor your codebase to improve its quality, and embrace testing as a means to ensure reliability and prevent regressions. Lastly, invest time in understanding the problem domain thoroughly before diving into coding, for clarity at the start saves days of debugging later." 

In essence, the wisdom lies in writing clean, maintainable code that solves the problem effectively without unnecessary complexity.

- Today's programming wisdom is to prioritize tasks, plan your time wisely, and stay organized. This will help you to be more efficient and productive in your work. Here are some tips to keep in mind:

1. Break down large projects into smaller, manageable tasks.
2. Set deadlines for each task and prioritize them according to their importance and urgency. 
3. Use task management tools like Trello, Asana, or Todoist to stay on track and organized throughout the project. These tools can help with tracking tasks and deadlines, as well as collaboration with team members.  
4. Learn to say "no" to tasks that are outside of your scope or don't align with your goals. It'll save you time and energy in the long run.   
5. Stay up-to-date with the latest programming technologies and tools. Learning new skills and adapting to new tools will make you a more valuable asset to your team or organization.    
6. Don'ts: Procrastinate, avoid important tasks or decisions, be afraid to ask for help, work in isolation, neglect to document your code or processes, etc.     
7. Lastly, remember to take breaks and give yourself time to recharge. Burnout is real, so make sure you're taking care of yourself physically and mentally.

- Today's programming wisdom is to be a lifelong learner. As technology continues to evolve at an unprecedented rate, it is essential to stay up-to-date with the latest developments and techniques. This involves constantly reading, researching, and practicing new skills.

To be an effective programmer, you must also have a strong foundation in basic programming concepts, such as data structures, algorithms, software engineering, computer science theory, etc. These fundamentals will serve as a guide for solving complex problems and developing innovative solutions. 
 - 学习编程语言和框架。了解不同的编程范式，如面向对象编程、函数式编程等。
- Continuously practice your skills by solving problems, building projects, or contributing to open source initiatives.This will not only improve your programming abilities but also help you develop a deeper understanding of the field.- Stay up to date with industry trends and developments. Follow blogs, newsletters, podcasts, conferences,and other resources to keep informed about new technologies and best practices.

- "Today's programming wisdom: 'Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.' — Leonardo da Vinci. In software development, strive to write clean, readable code that can be easily understood and maintained. This means using clear abstractions, minimizing complexity, and avoiding unnecessary features or premature optimizations. Always remember that you're not just writing code for machines to execute but also for humans to read, review, and evolve over time." 

"Another pearl of wisdom: 'Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.' — Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman. This highlights the importance of clarity and expressiveness in your code, which significantly impacts its longevity and maintainability."

- "Today's programming wisdom is: 'Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.' – Leonardo da Vinci. In software development, it means that writing clean, maintainable code with minimal complexity often leads to more robust and efficient solutions. Strive to break down problems into their simplest components, avoid unnecessary abstractions, and always aim for clarity and readability in your programs." 

In practical terms, this could mean favoring well-named functions and variables, adhering to established design patterns, avoiding premature optimization, and constantly refactoring to improve code quality. It also emphasizes the importance of choosing the right tools and libraries for a task, as they can greatly simplify your work without adding undue complexity. 

Remember, the goal is not just to make something that works, but to make something that is easy to understand, adapt, and extend over time—because in programming, today's solution may very well become tomorrow's legacy code.
